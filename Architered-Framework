Thw Well-Architected framework with Five pillars.

1. Operational Excellence
2. Security
3. Relability
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Cost Optimiztion

-----------------------
Operational Excellence: 
-----------------------   
  Design Principals
     1. Perform Operation as code.
     2. Annotated Documentation
     3. Make Frequent, Small Reversible Changes.
     4. Refine Operations Procedure Frequently
     5. Anticipate Failure
     6. Learn from operaton Falure.
     
-----------------------
Security: 
-----------------------
  Design Principals:
     1. Implement a Strong identity Foundation
     2. Enable Traceability
     3. Aplly Security at all Levels
     4. Automate Security best Practices
     5. Protect data in transit and at rest
     6. Keep people away from Data
     7. Prepare for security Events.

-----------------------
Reliability: 
-----------------------
  Design Principals:
    1. Test Recovery Procedure
    2. Automatically recover from Failure
    3. Scale Horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
    4. Stop Guessing Capacity.
    5. Manage change in Automation
    
-----------------------
Performance Efficiency: 
-----------------------
  Design Principals:  
       1. Democratize advanced technologies
       2. Go global in minutes
       3. Use serverless architectures
       4. Experient more often
       5. Mechanical Sympathy.
