s3 Notes
---------
The service offers unlimited storage space and stores your data in a highly available and durable way.

Examples of object storage
---------------------------
Unstructured data such as music, images, and videos. 
Backup and log files. Large sets of historical data. Archived file


One of the fundamental components
- infinite scaling options
- Many websites in the world run on s3
- so many components are intergraged with s3


Consdering the performance EBS vs S3 
------------------------------------
Amazon EBS is faster storage and offers high performance as compared to S3.


Considering the cost EBS vs S3
-------------------------------
Amazon S3 is cheapest for data storage al

Usecases of Object storage
--------------------------
Compared to a traditional file system, the disadvantage of object storage is that data consistency is achieved only eventually. 
Whenever you update a file, you may have to wait until the change is propagated to all of the replicas before requests will return the latest version. This makes object storage unsuitable for data that changes frequently.
But it's a great fit for all the data that doesn't change much, like backups, archives, video and audio files, 
and virtual machine images

Buckets
--------
Name shoud be globally unique
Buckets should be defined in the regional level
No upper case
no underscole
No Ip address

Objects
--------
we can say objects inside the bucket.
Max size of 5TB 
we cannot upload a object greater than 5GB, we need to use multi-part upload.
Each object can have 
    - metadata 
    -Tags:: useful for security/lifecycle


How to open object in the s3 bucket=
- click on the object :- which is using the presigned URL 
- using the public  url // access denied.


Versioning 
--------------

you can version your file in Amazon s3
it is enabled at bucket level
It wont overwrite 
Its is best practice to verion your buckets.

Notes:-
Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have versioning null
Supending versioning does not delete the previous versions.


while deleting the objects, it will create the delete marker first.
if we have delete the objecet permanatly we need delete the delete marker
(This will role back to previous version)


S3 Encryption for Objects
-------------------------

4 methods to encrypt
SSE-s3 encrypts s3 objects using keys handles and managed by AWS
SSE-KMS leverage AWS key Management services to manage encryption keys
SSE-C when you want to manage your own keys
client side Encryptions


SSE-s3
Encryption using keys handled anad manged by amazon s3
Objects is encrypted server side
AWS-256 encryption side
header :- x-amz-server-side-encryption "AES256"
