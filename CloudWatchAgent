CloudWatchAgent
---------------
Topics:
1. Installing cloudwatch Agent
2. Configuring using wizard
3. Process monitoring



First of all create required IAM roles for the EC2 instances to be able to send metrics to cloudwatch
In the list of policies while creating IAM Role for EC2 Instance, select the check box next to "CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy". Use the search box to find the policy, if necessary.

Launch an EC2 instance with port 80 and 22 open in the security group.
SSH into the instance

Find the cloudwatch agent download link here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-first-instance.html

Download the Cloudwatch Unified Agent. Find the right agent link for your OS by visiiting the above link

wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
Install the Cloudwatch Agent
sudo rpm -U ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
or sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent


Configure the Cloudwatch agent with the help of a setup wizard:
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
Choose all the default option except don't install statd and collectd. Selecy YES when asked to collect Memory Utilization metric. Select NO when asked if you want to monitor log files.

Start the agent
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json -s

You should be set! We'll explore the collected metrics now.
Part 2 : View the collected cloudwatch custom metrics
In the first part of this lab we configured the cloudwatch Unified agent. Now let's look at the metrics collected by the agent.

Remember: RAM/Memory metrics are not collected by Cloudwatch by default. Cloudwatch agent enables us to collect those metrics not collected by default.

In the config wizard we selected to collect Metrics like Ram etc


we can monitor other than infra specs like log,process,best practice is to segreagate into different files
like infra.json and process.json

Please use below commands
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/tmp/infrastructure.json -s
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a append-config -m ec2 -c file:/tmp/app.json -s
Note: first one should fetch_config and secon_cpne should be append_config


##Process Monitoring in Cloudwatch

Step1:
create a process.json file in the path
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin

step2:
In this case im monitoring on single process
{
        "metrics": {
                "metrics_collected": {
                        "procstat": [{
                                "pid_file": "/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/var/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.pid",
                                "measurement": [
                                        "cpu_usage",
                                        "memory_rss"
                                ]
                        }]
                }
        }
}

Note: if you have multiple process 

---->
{
    "metrics": {
        "metrics_collected": {
            "procstat": [
                {
                    "pid_file": "/var/run/example1.pid",
                    "measurement": [
                        "cpu_usage",
                        "memory_rss"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "pid_file": "/var/run/example2.pid",
                    "measurement": [
                        "read_bytes",
                        "read_count",
                        "write_bytes"
                    ],
                    "metrics_collection_interval": 10
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
----->

Step3
Append the configration,since cloudwatch already started basic infra 
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a append-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/process.json -s^
